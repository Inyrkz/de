# SQL Fundamentals

SQL is a must-have skill for data engineers. They use the querying language to perform essential tasks like modeling data, extracting performance metrics, and developing reusable data structures.

Data engineer SQL questions tend to mirror the work that engineers do.

Therefore, data engineers need to be proficient not just in querying data and pulling metrics, but also in data structures, manipulation and security within SQL. Broadly, a data engineer may face SQL questions in these categories:

- SQL queries - Using SQL data query language (DQL) statements to pull metrics and analyze data. Commands to know: SELECT
- Data modeling - Using DDL commands to create database schema and define data structures. Commands to know: CREATE, ALTER, DROP, RENAME, TRUNCATE, COMMENT
- Data manipulation - Using DML statements to retrieve and manipulate data. Commands to know: INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, MERGE, CALL, EXPLAIN PLAN, LOCK TABLE
- Data security - Using DCL (data control language) commands to manage database security. Commands to know: GRANT, REVOKE

This data engineering SQL questions guide provides an overview of the types of questions you might face, as well as an example data engineer interview questions to help you prepare for your interview.

# NoSQL Data Modeling

## Steps

### Cassandra NoSQL Data Modeling

1. [Lab: Email System Datamodel](./cassandra-email-data-model/)
1. [Lab: Digital Music Library Datamodel](./cassandra-digital-music-library/)
1. [Lab: Temperature Monitoring Sensor Networks Datamodel](./cassandra-sensor-data-model/)
1. [Lab: Investment Accounts or Portfolios Datamodel](./cassandra-investment-data-model/)
1. [Lab: Online Shopping Carts Datamodel](./cassandra-shopping-cart-data-model/)
1. [Lab: Hotel Reservations Datamodel](./cassandra-hotel-reservations/)

### Lab submission instructions

1. Understand the Requirements
2. Understand the Data
3. Analyze the Query Patterns
4. Design the Cassandra NoSQL Data Model in NoSQL Workbench
5. Load the Data Model in Amazon Keyspaces
6. Verify the Data Model via Amazon Console
7. Write DML in Python to ingest the Data into the Data Model
8. Save all the assets (code/images/screenshots/links) into a folder of your name under `assignments > data-modeling-cassandra`.
9. Create the GitHub Pull Request (PR) and add the instructor as the code reviewer.
10. Notify the Instructor and wait for the feedback.

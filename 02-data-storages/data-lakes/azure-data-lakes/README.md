# Azure Data Lakes

Azure Data Lake is a highly scalable and durable object-based cloud storage solution from Microsoft. It is optimized to store large amounts of structured and semi-structured data such as logs, application data, and documents.

Azure Data Lake can be used as a data source and destination in data engineering projects. As a source, it can be used to stage structured or semi-structured data. As a destination, it can be used to store the result of a data pipeline.

Azure Data Lake is provisioned as a storage account in Azure, capable of storing files (blobs), tables, or queues. Azure Blob storage is []()one of the four storage services available in Azure Storage. The other storage services are  **Table** ,  **Queue** , and  **File Share** . Table storage is used to store non-relational structured data as key-value pairs, queue storage is used to store messages as queues, and file share is used for creating file share directories/mount points that can be accessed using the NFS/SMB protocols.

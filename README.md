## How to start

There are 3 ways to start your data engineering journey: 

1. Agile mode: You will design your own learning modules and I will be your scrum master, guiding you in your learning path.
1. Monologue mode: I will be showing you the process on my screen and you will be asking questions/doubts.
1. Interactive mode: You will be doing the hands-on on your system and I will be guiding you step by step.
